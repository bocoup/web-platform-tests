This directory only contains auxiliary font files used by other tests. See
/css-fonts for tests covering the CSS Fonts Module specification.

The font named `Ahem.ttf` is referenced from the project documentation and the
CLI's scripts for provisioning Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS. If that file
is re-located, those references should be updated accordingly.
