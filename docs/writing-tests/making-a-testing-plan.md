# Making a Testing Plan

When contributing to a project as large and open-ended as WPT, it's easy to get
lost in the details. Starting with an informal testing strategy helps you
anticipate how much work will be involved, and it helps you stay focused once
you begin.

Many people come to WPT with a general testing goal in mind:

- specification authors often want to test for new spec text
- browser maintainers often want to test new features or fixes to existing
  features
- web developers often want to test discrepancies between browsers on their web
  applications

But if you don't have any particular goal, we can still help you get started.
Check out [the issues labeled with `type:missing-coverage` on
GitHub.com](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/labels/type%3Amissing-coverage).
Leave a comment if you'd like to get started with one, and don't hesitate to
ask clarifying questions!

This guide will:

1. show you how to use the specifications to learn what kinds of tests will be
   most helpful
2. demonstrate methods for figuring out which tests (if any) have already been
   written for WPT
